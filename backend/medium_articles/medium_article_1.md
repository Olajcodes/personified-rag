# Title: An Automatic Win: My First Week Journey into AI with the TIIDELab Scholarship
"The harder I work, the luckier I get." - Samuel Goldwyn
Acceptance mailThe world of artificial intelligence has always intrigued me, but this past week, I took my first significant step into this fascinating domain through the TIIDELab AI Cohort 6 Fellowship. This unique opportunity, boosted by an automatic scholarship I received through the pre-fellowship program, has already proven to be a transformative experience.
From foundational Python programming to understanding the intricacies of machine learning and fine-tuning AI models, Week 1 has set an exciting tone for the journey ahead. Here's how it all unfolded:

---

Onboarding & Standups: Setting the Tone for Success
Onboarding ImageWe were warmly welcomed by Cynthia (Izuagie) Shobayo, the Program and Partnership Director at TIIDELab, and heard inspiring words from Kadir Salami, Founder of TIIDELab. We also met the amazing team members, including:
Gbotemi Adebayo (Communication Associate)
Aliu Increase (Programs Administrator)
Chibuzo Success Godswill (Task Master)
Emilefo Grace (Volunteer)

TIIDELab TeamTo top it off, Mr. Daniel Wilson, Lead Facilitator and Founder of XRI Global, gave us a taste of what the AI journey would involve. And let's not forget Mr. Aderoju Shamsudeen Adedapo, aka Mr. Shams, who shared invaluable insights from his experience as the immediate past Program Manager of TIIDELab. The onboarding session left me feeling excited and ready for the road ahead.
Every day of the fellowship begins with a morning standup (scrum) at 10 AM, where we review the previous day's class, discuss key insights, and align on goals for the day ahead. These sessions have not only kept us on track but have also fostered a supportive and collaborative learning environment. We discuss our progress, address challenges, and dive deep into class reviews; a great way to start the day energized and focused.
In addition, TIIDELab goes the extra mile by providing each fellow with a 30GB data subscription, ensuring that we have the necessary resources to fully engage in our learning journey. This thoughtful provision underscores TIIDELab's commitment to removing barriers to success and makes them stand out as an organization truly dedicated to the growth and development of its participants.
Day 2: Diving into Python Programming with Mr. Ibrahim Tijani
The first official class on Python programming was nothing short of exhilarating! Mr. Ibrahim Tijani guided us through Python fundamentals, emphasizing how Python serves as the backbone of many AI systems. We explored:
Data Types: Learning how to manipulate and work with numbers, strings, and lists was a real eye-opener.
Control Structures: From basic "if else" statements to loops, the hands-on practice really brought the concepts to life.
Running Python Programs: There is something incredibly rewarding about seeing your code run successfully for the first time!

Introduction to PythonDay 3: Machine Learning (ML) Foundations with Daniel Wilson
On Day 3, Mr. Daniel Wilson took us into the world of machine learning, providing a comprehensive overview of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. One of the key takeaways was the importance of aligning AI-driven solutions with real customer problems. This discussion was especially insightful, as we examined whether to create "vitamin" products (enhancements to existing systems) or "painkiller" products (solutions to urgent issues).
We also explored the implications of ChatGPT's rapid adoption and its cultural significance in enabling personalized AI experiences across diverse languages. A notable highlight was our deep dive into low-resource languages and their potential as blue ocean opportunities in the AI landscape.
Introduction to MLDay 4: Learning from Jonathan Shaw - The Power of Machine Learning
By Day 4, we were already knee-deep in machine learning. Jonathan Shaw broke down key concepts like neural networks, which mimic the human brain, and introduced us to the types of learning algorithms, including:
Supervised Learning: Training models using labeled data.
Unsupervised Learning: Allowing the model to identify patterns on its own.
Self-Supervised & Reinforcement Learning: These advanced approaches push machine learning boundaries, helping models learn from their actions and adjust in real-time.

We also explored essential technical concepts like tokenization and the QKV (Query, Key, Value) mechanism, used to process large datasets. The theory, coupled with practical applications, helped connect the dots for me as I began to see how machine learning is applied in everyday tech solutions.
Day 5: Fine-Tuning AI Models with Dillon Mee & Timothy Khouw
On Day 5, things got even more exciting. Dillon Mee and Timothy Khouw led us through a session on Fine-Tuning AI Models - the process of tailoring pre-trained models to improve performance for specific tasks or datasets. We explored:
Full Fine-Tuning: Adjusting the entire model to adapt to a new task.
LoRA Fine-Tuning: A resource-efficient approach that targets specific layers of a model.
QLoRA Fine-Tuning: Utilizing quantized weights for faster processing without sacrificing performance.

This session was particularly exciting because we had the opportunity to fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B base model using a small English dataset, allowing us to apply our newfound knowledge to a hands-on project.
Additionally, we were introduced to HuggingFace, a platform full of resources for model training, fine-tuning, and deployment. HuggingFace is now my go-to for understanding how large AI models are implemented and fine-tuned for specific applications.
In this session, we also split into two breakout rooms:
Non-Technical Room: Led by Dillon Mee, focusing on broader AI implementation aspects using Monster API.
Technical Room: Led by Timothy Khouw, where I dove deep into the hands-on process of fine-tuning the Llama model with step-by-step guidance.

Reflecting on Week 1: The Journey So Far
As I wrap up Week 1, I am amazed at how much I have learned in such a short amount of time. From foundational Python skills to advanced concepts like neural networks and fine-tuning, the learning curve has been steep but incredibly rewarding. The morning standups, led by miss Increase Aliu, have been a perfect way to start each day with purpose and clarity, ensuring we are aligned and motivated.
Though there have been moments where the material felt overwhelming (hello, neural networks and QKV!), the satisfaction of working through these challenges has been worth it. I am super excited to dive deeper into fine-tuning and take full advantage of platforms like HuggingFace in future projects.
The coming weeks promise even more learning and growth, and I am ready to keep pushing myself as I explore the limitless potential of AI. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this incredible journey!
